# Algoritm Collections

### Welcome!

This repository contains a collection of various algorithms implemented in python via jupyter notebook. These algorithms are designed to be well-documented, efficient, and easy to understand. I am documenting them while on my journey as a Data Scientist.

### What's included:

* A diverse range of algorithms covering different problem domains (e.g., sorting, searching, graph algorithms, etc.).
* Clear and concise documentation for each algorithm, explaining its purpose, time and space complexity, and usage.
* Well-structured and commented code for readability and maintainability.
* Unit tests for verifying the correctness of each algorithm implementation.

### Explore the code:

Each algorithm is located in its own `.ipynb` file. You can browse the code and documentation within each directory.
